Experimenting with close proximity communication and geolocation algorithms.

## Insights Gained

This project is no longer maintained as I achieved the goal of completing its objectives. The server logic runs on memory but a Redis database can be integrated to improve performance and scalability. The UI is a bit of a work in progress, and the chat function works, albeit with a few bugs that need squashing.

The most significant facet of knowledge I gained from this project, with the generous assistance of [Jasir Zaeem](https://github.com/JasirZaeem), was an understanding of geolocation proximity. This includes components such as its algorithms - quadtree, geohash, among others - and the basic concept of how it works and what problems it solves.
